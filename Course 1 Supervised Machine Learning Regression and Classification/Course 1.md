Course 1 of Machine Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Supervised Machine Learning : Regression and Classification.

In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, we will:
• Build Machine Learning models in Python using popular Machine Learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
• Build and train Supervised Machine Learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.

The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. 
In this we will learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. 

This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and 
groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.

This 3-course Specialization is an updated and expanded version of Andrew’s pioneering Machine Learning course,
rated 4.9 out of 5 and taken by over 4.8 million learners since it launched in 2012. 

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression,
logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, 
recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning 
innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

By the end of this Specialization, we will have mastered key concepts and gained the practical know-how to quickly and powerfully 
apply Machine Learning to challenging real-world problems.
