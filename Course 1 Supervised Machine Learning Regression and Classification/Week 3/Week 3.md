# Week 3

Course 1 of Machine Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Supervised Machine Learning : Regression and Classification.

Week 3

In Week 3, we will learn the other type of supervised learning, classification.
Learn how to predict categories using the logistic regression model. 
And also learn about the problem of overfitting, and how to handle this problem with a method called regularization.
And get to practice implementing logistic regression with regularization at the end of this week.

## Learning Objectives

* Use logistic regression for binary classification.
* Implement logistic regression for binary classification.
* Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance.
