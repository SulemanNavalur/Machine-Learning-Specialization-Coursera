# Week 2

Course 1 of Machine Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Supervised Machine Learning : Regression and Classification.

Week 2

In Week 2, we will extend linear regression to handle multiple input features. 
And also learn some methods for improving the model's training and performance,
such as vectorization, feature scaling, feature engineering and polynomial regression.
At the end of the week, we will get to practice implementing linear regression in code.

## Learning Objectives

* Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression.
* Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training.
