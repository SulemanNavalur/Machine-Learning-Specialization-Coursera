# Week 1

Course 3 of Machine Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning.

Week 1
 
In Week 1, we will learn two key unsupervised learning algorithms: clustering and anomaly detection.

## Learning Objectives

* Implement the k-means clustering algorithm.
* Implement the k-means optimization objective.
* Initialize the k-means algorithm.
* Choose the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm.
* Implement an anomaly detection system.
* Decide when to use supervised learning vs. anomaly detection.
* Implement the centroid update function in k-means.
* Implement the function that finds the closest centroids to each point in k-means.
