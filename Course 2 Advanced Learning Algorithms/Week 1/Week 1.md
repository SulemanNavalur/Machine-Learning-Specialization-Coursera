# Week 3

Course 2 of Machine Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Advanced Learning Algorithms.

Week 3
 
In Week 3, we will learn best practices for training and evaluating your learning algorithms to improve performance. This will cover a wide range of useful advice about the machine learning lifecycle, tuning your model, and also improving your training data..

## Learning Objectives

* Evaluate and then modify your learning algorithm or data to improve your model's performance.
* Evaluate your learning algorithm using cross validation and test datasets.
* Diagnose bias and variance in your learning algorithm.
* Use regularization to adjust bias and variance in your learning algorithm.
* Identify a baseline level of performance for your learning algorithm.
* Understand how bias and variance apply to neural networks.
* Learn about the iterative loop of Machine Learning Development that's used to update and improve a machine learning model.
* Learn to use error analysis to identify the types of errors that a learning algorithm is making.
* Learn how to add more training data to improve your model, including data augmentation and data synthesis.
* Use transfer learning to improve your model's performance.
* Learn to include fairness and ethics in your machine learning model development.
* Measure precision and recall to work with skewed (imbalanced) datasets.
