# Week 4

Course 2 of Machine Learning Specialization Coursera.

Course - Advanced Learning Algorithms.

Week 4
 
In Week 4, we will learn a practical and very commonly used learning algorithm the decision tree. You'll also learn about variations of the decision tree, including random forests and boosted trees (XGBoost).

## Learning Objectives

* See what a decision tree looks like and how it can be used to make predictions.
* Learn how a decision tree learns from training data.
* Learn the "impurity" metric "entropy" and how it's used when building a decision tree.
* Learn how to use multiple trees, "tree ensembles" such as random forests and boosted trees.
* Learn when to use decision trees or neural networks.
